### How the decoder works
The decoder consists of the following steps:
1. Find the code in the image. 
  The detection algorithm is simple and not very robust. 
  We look for the largest square contour in the image.
  It is largely inspired by [this tutorial](https://pyimagesearch.com/2021/10/27/automatically-ocring-receipts-and-scans/).
  For implementation details see [`bunt/detect.py`](https://github.com/pypae/bunt/blob/main/bunt/detect.py).
1. Transform the detected area to a 560x560 pixel image.
1. Detect the color and shape of each quadrant of the code.
  To detect the color, we average the color of the pixels around a circle in the center of the quadrant.
  We then compute the euclidian distance to the list of known colors and pick the closest one.
  To detect the shape, we look at each corner of the quadrant and check if it is filled.
  See the debug output above for an example.
  For implementation details see [`bunt/decode.py`](https://github.com/pypae/bunt/blob/main/bunt/decode.py).
1. Verify the CRC and extract the original data.

### Things to try next
- Reduce the error rate in color detection by adjusting color balance and/or using a different color space.
- Improve the detection algorithm. (E.g. use a neural network.)
